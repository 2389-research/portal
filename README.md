# WebRTC Video Chat

A simple peer-to-peer video chat application using WebRTC, Python, and modular JavaScript with Parcel bundler.

## Features

- Create and join video chat rooms
- Real-time video and audio communication
- Text chat with message notifications
- Toggle self-view (hide/show your own video)
- Device selection (camera and microphone)
- Mute audio and pause video controls
- Copy room ID to invite others
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Screen sharing functionality
- Modular frontend architecture with clean separation of concerns

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- Node.js and npm (for Parcel bundler)
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Frontend source code
  - `js/`: JavaScript modules
    - `webrtc.js`: WebRTC connection handling
    - `media.js`: Media device access and control
    - `chat.js`: Chat functionality
    - `signaling.js`: Communication with server
    - `room.js`: Main room page logic
    - `index.js`: Home page logic
  - `css/`: Stylesheet files
  - `html/`: HTML templates
- `public/`: Built frontend files (generated by Parcel)
- `server.py`: Flask server

## Installation

### Local Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Python requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker Setup

1. Build and run using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Or, build and run using Docker directly:

```bash
docker build -t webrtc-video-chat .
docker run -p 5000:5000 webrtc-video-chat
```

## Usage

### Running in Development Mode

1. Start the Parcel development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. In a separate terminal, start the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Running in Production

1. Build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python server.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Deploying to Fly.io

1. Install the Fly CLI tool:

```bash
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
```

2. Log in to your Fly.io account:

```bash
fly auth login
```

3. Deploy the application:

```bash
fly launch
```

4. For subsequent deployments:

```bash
fly deploy
```

## Room Usage

1. Create a new room or join an existing room by entering its Room ID

2. Share the Room ID with others to invite them to your video chat

3. Use the controls to toggle audio/video, show/hide self-view, and open the chat

4. Allow camera and microphone access when prompted

## Debug Logging

The application includes comprehensive debug logging:

- Server-side logs are printed to the console
- Client-side logs can be viewed in the browser's developer console

## Notes

- This application uses a simplified signaling mechanism
- In a production environment, you would typically:
  - Use WebSockets for real-time signaling
  - Implement user authentication
  - Add additional TURN servers for NAT traversal
  - Enhance security features

## Troubleshooting

- If you can't see or hear other participants:
  - Check that your camera and microphone are working
  - Make sure you've allowed the browser to access your media devices
  - Try a different browser or device
  - Check if your network allows WebRTC traffic
  - Open browser console to see debug messages

## Technical Implementation

- **Server**: Flask web server for serving pages and handling signaling
- **Client**: Pure JavaScript implementation of WebRTC
- **Signaling**: REST API endpoints (in a real app, this would use WebSockets)
- **STUN servers**: Google's public STUN servers for NAT traversal
- **Media Negotiation**: Standard WebRTC offer/answer mechanism
